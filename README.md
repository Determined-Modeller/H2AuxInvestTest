### Our Mission
In Scotland's Hydrogen Supply Chain, knowledge transfer faces significant hurdles. H2AuxInvest is dedicated towards turning this current weakness into a sector-wide strength with an open ecosystem.


### The Challenge

#### Lack of Accessible Information
Developers often face difficulties in obtaining reliable information on low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) components from smaller manufacturers. This situation frequently leads to:
- Preference for mature technologies from established international vendors.
- Compromise on performance across essential metrics.

#### Specific Issues Identified:
- **Data Scarcity:** Unavailable or unverifiable data from manufacturers.
- **Performance Uncertainty:** A gap between real-world performance and the information publicly available.
- **Late-stage Data Procurement:** Projects have high sunk costs by the time real data is available.
- **Outdated Tools:** Existing modelling tools require expert skills for simple estimation or are either generic, obsolete, or irrelevant.
- **Investment Risks:** Significant risk premiums associated with investing in low TRL equipment from smaller manufacturers.

### Our Solution

#### Open-Source Software Tool
We created a powerful open-source calculation tool, made it accessable and free to access, aiming to :
- Utilize real-world, low TRL datasets from new manufacturers alongside high TRL data.
- Allow for the easy integration of user data sources.
- Generate key metrics to enable informed equipment investment decisions.

### Vision for H2AuxInvest

#### A Comprehensive Webtool
H2AuxInvest aims to provide a platform that offers:
- **Optimisation and Sizing:** Shortcut methods for storage and compression based on user inputs.
- **Financial Insights:** Detailed CAPEX and OPEX comparisons of low TRL solutions against established systems.
- **Clear Reporting:** Comprehensive reports highlighting key metrics, design limitations, and recommendations.
- **Full Value Chain:** The project aims to expand the tool to cover hydrogen thermal demands, and accurately estimate transport and storage costs from a supply site of your choice.
- **Supply Chain Visibility:** The project aims to build, update and share up-to-date open-source cost correlations for multiple low TRL and novel hydrogen technologies.
- **Benchmarking and Estimation:** Our tool encourages a free comparison of key variables, capable of exploring different multi-technology approaches.
- **Trusted Partner:** Working with manufacturers using a transparent and fair verification process, we allow them to share important information for potential users and investors in H2 infrastructure

#### Community and Accessibility
- **Open-Source Collaboration:** We use forums and contributions to foster a rich knowledge-sharing environment.
- **Accessibility Standards:** Ensuring the tool meets accessibility guidelines for all users.

### The Impact

#### Completing the Puzzle
By increasing access to finance and reducing the cost of financing, we aim to:
- Boost investor confidence.
- Overcome barriers due to high initial capital expenditure.
- Support Scottish component manufacturers and the green hydrogen project pipeline.
- Enable successful projects at various scales using innovative technology.
