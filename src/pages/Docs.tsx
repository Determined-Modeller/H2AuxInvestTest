<h2>Open-Source Software Tool</h2>
    <p>We created a powerful open-source calculation tool, made it accessible and free to access, aiming to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize real-world, low TRL datasets from new manufacturers alongside high TRL data.</li>
      <li>Allow for the easy integration of user data sources.</li>
      <li>Generate key metrics to enable informed equipment investment decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision for H2AuxInvest</h2>
    <p><strong>A Comprehensive Webtool</strong></p>
    <p>H2AuxInvest aims to provide a platform that offers:</p>

            title: "Choosing Your Inputs",
            content: `In this section the main input requirements, assumptions and hints are provided to help selection of inputs for non-expert users

            <h2>Supply Pressure</h2>
            <p>The supply pressure available to the site (either through tube trailers or gas distribution pipes) is essential for sizing and the hydrogen infrastructure.</p>
            <p>The placeholder assumption here is of a hydrogen pipeline connected to hydrogen distribution piping, delivering hydrogen at up to 7 bar. Should this instead be via tube trailer, please choose the specific tube trailer delivery pressure, usually available on a public datasheet or by request.</p>
            <p>If you are still unsure about what pressure to choose, but know you will not be connected to the gas distribution network, it is sensible to start with one of the following commonly used tube trailer pressures in industry:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>200 bar</li>
              <li>300 bar</li>
              <li>380 bar</li>
              <li>450 bar</li>
              <li>500 bar</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>H2 User</h2>
            <p>The parameters of the hydrogen demand (i.e., tank capacity and dispensing pressure of the vehicles) are crucial for specifying the correct hydrogen infrastructure. Please see the vehicle/trailer datasheet, or contact the vendor to confirm that this is correct.</p>
            <p>Jargon Buster - H35 is often used to indicate that fuelling is taking place at 350 bar and ambient temperature without precooling.</p>
            <p>If you are still unsure about what pressure to choose, but know you will be supplying tube trailers, it is sensible to start with one of the following commonly used configurations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>200 bar, 580kg H2</li>
              <li>300 bar, 840kg H2</li>
              <li>380 bar, 1000kg H2</li>
              <li>450 bar, 1150kg H2</li>
              <li>500 bar, 1300kg H2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are still unsure about what pressure to choose, but know you will be supplying small passenger vehicles, it is sensible to start with one of the following commonly used configurations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>350 bar, 5kg H2</li>
              <li>700 bar, 5kg H2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are still unsure about what pressure to choose, but know you will be supplying heavy duty vehicles, it is sensible to start with one of the following commonly used configurations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>350 bar, 30kg H2</li>
              <li>700 bar, 30kg H2</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>H2 Storage</h2>
            <p>Storage makes up a significant portion of the final cost of any hydrogen supply infrastructure, in this section, you specify what storage infrastructure you wish to use, outside of the fuelling cascade required to meet peak demand (when this is applicable).</p>
            <p>If you are directly connected to a part of the national gas grid, in an area where hydrogen will be usable you are advised to not include storage (unless operational integrity is a priority). A generally applied assumption where you are unsure about the distribution of hydrogen demand and do not have available profiles is to size this storage for a minimum of 2 days of demand on site, a worked example of this is below.</p>
            <p>Suggested minimum used storage = (number of vehicle fills over 2 days at peak frequency x vehicle storage tank size) or (peak hydrogen delivery flowrate required per hour * 48 hours)</p>
        
            <h2>H2 Demand</h2>
            <p>The distribution of hydrogen demand is an important part of accurately specifying and costing any hydrogen infrastructure. It is recommended that when finally designing hydrogen infrastructure, that this is completed, using expected/measured delivery and filling schedules, traffic data, vendor information, and other sources.</p>
            <p>However, for the purpose of shortcut estimation, as this information is rarely available during early estimation stages, peak and average supply rates can be used with a "standard" normal distribution. Application of more sophisticated options for a probabilistic approach, incorporating different standard profiles, considering queue theory and maximum number of back-to-back fills is an ongoing development task for the project.</p>
            <p>If you are unsure about this demand we suggest specifying this using the "vehicles per hour/vehicles per day" units options, specifying your peak demand by the highest number of fills you require during an hour/day. You should then select the average demand by selecting the "number of vehicles per hour/vehicles per day", filling in what you expect to be the average demand level.</p>
            <p>If you are looking to explore limitations on pressure selection please consider application of standard values from SAEJ2601. Generally speaking, a maximum filling velocity of 3.6 kg/min and 7.2 kg/min respectively are suggested for H35 and H70 Nozzles respectively. This can be used to estimate the upper bound of the peak flowrate demand.</p>
        
            <h2>Detailed Configuration</h2>
            <p>The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) represents a firm's blended cost of capital across all sources, including debt and equity, weighted by their respective proportions in the company's capital structure. Choosing a sensible WACC value is crucial for evaluating investment decisions and calculating the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows, where accuracy in estimating the cost components and their weights directly impacts investment appraisal outcomes.</p>
            <p>Sensible selection of WACC involves careful consideration of the current market conditions, the firm's capital structure, and risk factors, ensuring that the chosen rate realistically reflects the company's cost of financing. 12% is used as a standard value to be representative of current high interest rates and risk perception for hydrogen infrastructure. The cost of equity can be estimated using models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which considers the risk-free rate, the market risk premium, and the company's beta (a measure of its volatility compared to the market).</p>
            <p>The lifetime of the project depends on the intensity of use, maintenance applied and replacement schedule, a standard assumption used is to assume a lifetime in the range of 15-25 years.</p>
            <p>Precooling is used to refrigerate hydrogen coming out of storage to achieve a higher number of back-to-back fills and higher State of Charge "SoC" in the hydrogen tanks, this model assumes an ambient filling model (no precooling) where precooling is not selected, and where it is selected, thermodynamic equations are applied to cool hydrogen to -40Â°C, as per the standard SAEJ2601. There is currently no ability to change this assumption in the tool, which is an active development task.</p>
